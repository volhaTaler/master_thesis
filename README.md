Abstract
Trust is social glue required for the development of any ecient relationship, which is crucial not only in the interpersonal context but also in the human-
robot interactions. Today, researchers are putting significant eort into creating social human-like robots, which would behave like people and be able to express
emotions, empathy and nonverbal communication cues. Nevertheless, since we live in a human-centered society, where the human is still considered to be the
"crown of creation", a lot of studies address the question of human trust toward robots. Yet only a few studies have addressed the concept of trust from a robot
perspective: how to model and form trust in the robot toward its interaction partners. Here, we aim to put forward a computational model to address this gap.

The introduced model serves as a novel social-cognitive trust framework, which equips the Pepper robot with an ability to assess the trustworthiness of its interaction
partners based on both: (i) the cognitive load (i.e., the cost of perceptual processing) and (ii) social cues (i.e., perceived body posture and gestures). This work describes the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of the introduced framework.
In order to evaluate the ecacy of the framework, the Pepper robot was set to accomplish a visual recall task. During this task the robot interacted with human partners, which followed dierent behavioral strategies: reliable, unreliable, deceptive, or random. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed framework
allows the Pepper robot to dierentiate the guiding strategies from each other and choose the most trustworthy partner in the situation when a free choice of the interaction partner for the next task is oered. It also provides a hint on how to recognize if an interaction partner acts in a deceptive manner.
